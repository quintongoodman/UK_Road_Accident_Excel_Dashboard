## PROJECT OVERVIEW

In this project, I developed an Excel Road Accident Dashboard to analyze and visualize traffic accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The aim was to gain valuable insights that can shape road safety policies and reduce casualties resulting from accidents. Through this project, I showcased my expertise in data analysis and visualization using Excel.

## KEY FEATURES

- Interactive dashboard presenting key insights on road accidents and casualties

- Data filtering options by accident dates (month and year) and rural/urban setting

- Visual representations of data using various charts, including bar charts, donut charts, tree maps, and line charts

- Custom number formatting to highlight the magnitude of total casualties

 
## METHODOLOGY

- Utilized a dataset in XLSX format with 21 fields and 32,000 rows obtained from Kaggle

- Converted the data into a table format for efficient filtering and sorting

- Performed data cleaning by checking for null values and correcting typos

- Extracted month and year information from accident dates using Excel functions

- Generated pivot tables to analyze primary and secondary Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

 
## INSIGHTS

- Identified trends and patterns in accident severity and vehicle types involved

- Examined casualties by different vehicle types and their contributions to total casualties

- Analyzed monthly comparisons of casualties between the current and previous years

- Determined maximum casualties by road type and distribution of casualties by road surface

- Explored the relationship between casualties by area/location and day/night periods

 
## IMPACT

The Excel Road Accident Dashboard provides essential information to stakeholders, including the Ministry of Transport, Road Transport Department, Police Force, Emergency Services Department, Road Safety Corps, Transport Operators, Traffic Management Agencies, Public, and Media. These insights can assist in shaping road safety policies, allocating resources effectively, and implementing targeted interventions to reduce casualties and enhance road safety.

## INSIGHTS

I am excited to share this project and discuss its implications with professionals in the field. Feel free to explore the interactive dashboard and reach out to me for further information, collaboration, or any insights you may have. Let's work together towards safer roads and a brighter future
